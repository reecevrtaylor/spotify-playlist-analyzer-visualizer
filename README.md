# Spotify Playlist Analyzer + Visualizer

## User Authentication:
* Implement Spotify's OAuth 2.0 user authentication to allow users to log in with their Spotify account and access their playlists.

## Playlist Selection:
* Once logged in, the users can select one or multiple playlists that they want to analyze and visualize.

## Data Retrieval:
* Use Spotify's Web API to retrieve data about the selected playlists. The data should include basic playlist information (like song names, artists, album, etc.)

## Data Analysis:
Analyze the retrieved data to provide insights about the playlists, such as:
* The most common artists.
* The average tempo.
* Song distribution by year or decade.
* The genre distribution.

# Data Visualization:
Create interactive visualizations for the analyzed data, such as:

* A pie chart showing the genre distribution.
* A scatter plot showing the correlation between different audio features.
* A bar graph showing the most common artists.
* A timeline showing song distribution by year or decade.

## Data Export:
Allow users to export the analyzed data and visualizations in various formats (like CSV, PDF, etc.).
